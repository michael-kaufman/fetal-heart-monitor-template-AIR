# fetal-heart-monitor-template-as3

#Summary

This is a fetal heart monitor reader and annotation application I built for Mac and PC.  It's interface has now been updated and evolved, and it is used by many attorneys in cases involved in premature deaths of infants. 

#Viewing

Adding the main view class. This project is far too large to put in Github, however, to view the finished OSX and PC applications you can download here:

PC - www.mkmultimedia.net/labs/digistrip/Digistrip-PC.zip
OSX www.mkmultimedia.net/labs/digistrip/MAC.zip

I can provide full code upon request.
